# Abstract:
This project aims to implement a parallelized diffusion simulation using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to achieve high computational efficiency and scalability. Diffusion simulations are typically resource-intensive, especially when modeling high-resolution spatial and temporal data. A sequential approach limits performance on large datasets, making it impractical for extensive, multi-dimensional models. By integrating MPI, we will distribute computation across multiple nodes, significantly reducing runtime and enabling more complex simulations.
# 1. Problem Statement

Diffusion is a fundamental process in physics, biology, and chemistry, describing how substances move from regions of higher concentration to lower concentration. This project addresses the computational challenge of simulating diffusion over extensive grids in multi-dimensional spaces. A sequential simulation can quickly become computationally prohibitive as grid size and resolution increase, making them impractical for large-scale high-resolution models. Using MPI to parallelize the simulation will allow for handling larger and more detailed configurations within a reasonable timeframe, facilitating more in-depth studies in scientific fields that rely on diffusion modeling.
